# Vision

## Product Thesis

locus.codes is a terminal-native coding agent where every interaction becomes deterministic memory, and every memory becomes future intelligence.

## What Makes It Different

Claude Code is prompt-driven. locus.codes is **experience-driven**.

The system improves permanently because memory is deterministic and reinforced. There are no AGENTS.md files, no skill files, no static configuration. The agent learns from experience — every diff, every test result, every commit becomes a locus in LocusGraph that shapes future behavior.

## Core Identity

- **Terminal-native**: built with ratatui + crossterm, not a web app
- **Frontier models**: self-hosted LLMs, no external API dependency
- **Implicit memory**: the LLM behaves like a human — it remembers without knowing the storage system exists
- **Deterministic**: all events are deterministic, reproducible, auditable
- **Multi-model**: right model for right task (Rush / Smart / Deep)
- **Opinionated**: only ships features that work well
- **On the frontier**: evolves with models, no legacy baggage

## The One Rule

The LLM is stateless compute. LocusGraph is the permanent brain. The agent's intelligence lives in its accumulated experience, not in its prompt.
