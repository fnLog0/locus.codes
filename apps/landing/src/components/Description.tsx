        locus.codes is a <strong>frontier coding agent</strong> (terminal + editor) with <strong>LocusGraph</strong> as implicit memory. No AGENTS.md, no Skills — the agent learns from every interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built it for <strong>developers</strong> who want an AI that remembers context, conventions, and past decisions. <strong>Multi-model</strong>, opinionated, and on the frontier: smart, rush, and deep modes for every kind of task.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>locus.codes truly represents the coding spirit of agents that think with memory.</strong>
